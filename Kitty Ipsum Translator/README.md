In this 140-lesson course, you will learn some more complex commands, and the details of how commands work.

The first thing you need to do is start the terminal. Do that by clicking the "hamburger" menu at the top left of the screen, going to the "terminal" section, and clicking "new terminal". Once you open a new one, type `echo hello bash` into the terminal and press enter.

The command you just entered printed to the terminal. You can redirect that output to a file using >. Hereâ€™s an example: <command> > <filename>. Enter the same command but redirect the output into stdout.txt.

A stdout.txt file was created. You should take a look at it. Instead of printing hello bash to the terminal, it redirected the output to the file. A single > will create or overwrite the file. Use the same command with >> to append to the file.

>> apends

 > overrites the files
